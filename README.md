# PPP Model Project

A flexible and optimizable PPP (Predictive, Performance, and Precision) model used for analyzing housing data and predicting PPP values across multiple countries. This project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor model to predict PPP values based on various economic indicators.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Merges multiple data sources and handles country-specific transformations.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains a Random Forest model for predicting PPP values.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R² to evaluate model performance.
- **Open-Source**: Available for contribution and improvement by the community.

## Installation

To get started with the PPP Model Project, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PPP-ModelHub.git
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

## Example Output

After running the model, the following metrics will be printed:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² (R-squared)
